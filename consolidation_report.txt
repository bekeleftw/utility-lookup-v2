## PARENT-COMPANY ERRORS (from CORPORATE_MERGERS)
   These map an operating utility to a holding company.
   The holding company should NEVER be returned as a provider name.

  1. "integrys energy" -> "WEC Energy Group"
     Reason: "WEC Energy Group" is a holding company, not an operating utility
     Action: Should be parent_company metadata, not an alias

  2. "peoples gas chicago" -> "WEC Energy Group"
     Reason: "WEC Energy Group" is a holding company, not an operating utility
     Action: Should be parent_company metadata, not an alias

  3. "midamerican energy" -> "Berkshire Hathaway Energy"
     Reason: "Berkshire Hathaway Energy" is a holding company, not an operating utility
     Action: Should be parent_company metadata, not an alias

  4. "pacificorp" -> "Berkshire Hathaway Energy"
     Reason: "Berkshire Hathaway Energy" is a holding company, not an operating utility
     Action: Should be parent_company metadata, not an alias

  5. "nv energy" -> "Berkshire Hathaway Energy"
     Reason: "Berkshire Hathaway Energy" is a holding company, not an operating utility
     Action: Should be parent_company metadata, not an alias

## PARENT COMPANY RELATIONSHIPS (metadata only)
   These are stored for reference but NEVER used for matching or display.

  Duke Energy Indiana (displays as "Duke Energy Indiana") -> parent: Duke Energy
  Georgia Power (displays as "Georgia Power") -> parent: Southern Company
  MidAmerican Energy (displays as "MidAmerican Energy") -> parent: Berkshire Hathaway Energy
  NV Energy (displays as "NV Energy") -> parent: Berkshire Hathaway Energy
  Piedmont Natural Gas (displays as "Piedmont Natural Gas") -> parent: Duke Energy
  WE Energies (displays as "WE Energies") -> parent: WEC Energy Group
